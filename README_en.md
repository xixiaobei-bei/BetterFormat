# <center> BetterFormat


[[简体中文](README.md)] [[English](README_en.md)]

I don't know how to write a README, so let me just tell you what this software does.

The formatting GUI for Windows right-click partitions was a temporary solution, but it was too ugly. I decided to write my own formatting GUI, so I developed this program using WinUI3.Click the BetterFormat option in the partition's right-click menu to use it.

Note: I'm still a middle school student. If you find any bugs, you can submit an issue—I’ll check them on weekends—or email me at: jiaxi120516@outlook.com

I will continue to update this project and add new features.
